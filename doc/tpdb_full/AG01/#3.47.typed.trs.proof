MAYBE
* Step 1: Failure MAYBE
  + Considered Problem:
      - Strict TRS:
          f(x,c(y)) -> f(x,s(f(y,y)))
          f(s(x),y) -> f(x,s(c(y)))
      - Signature:
          {f/2} / {c/1,s/1}
      - Obligation:
          innermost runtime complexity wrt. defined symbols {f} and constructors {c,s}
  + Applied Processor:
      NaturalPI {shape = Mixed 3, restrict = NoRestrict, uargs = UArgs, urules = URules, selector = Nothing}
  + Details:
      Incompatible
