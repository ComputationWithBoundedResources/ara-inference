MAYBE
* Step 1: Failure MAYBE
  + Considered Problem:
      - Strict TRS:
          f(x,s(s(y))) -> f(y,x)
          f(s(x),y) -> f(x,s(s(x)))
      - Signature:
          {f/2} / {s/1}
      - Obligation:
          innermost runtime complexity wrt. defined symbols {f} and constructors {s}
  + Applied Processor:
      NaturalMI {miDimension = 3, miDegree = 3, miKind = Algebraic, uargs = UArgs, urules = URules, selector = Nothing}
  + Details:
