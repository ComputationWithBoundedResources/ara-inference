MAYBE
* Step 1: Failure MAYBE
  + Considered Problem:
      - Strict TRS:
          f(x,y,s(z)) -> s(f(0(),1(),z))
          f(0(),1(),x) -> f(s(x),x,x)
      - Signature:
          {f/3} / {0/0,1/0,s/1}
      - Obligation:
          innermost runtime complexity wrt. defined symbols {f} and constructors {0,1,s}
  + Applied Processor:
      NaturalPI {shape = Mixed 3, restrict = NoRestrict, uargs = UArgs, urules = URules, selector = Nothing}
  + Details:
      Incompatible
