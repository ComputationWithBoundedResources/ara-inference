MAYBE
* Step 1: Failure MAYBE
  + Considered Problem:
      - Strict TRS:
          f(g(x)) -> f(a(g(g(f(x))),g(f(x))))
      - Signature:
          {f/1} / {a/2,g/1}
      - Obligation:
          innermost runtime complexity wrt. defined symbols {f} and constructors {a,g}
  + Applied Processor:
      NaturalPI {shape = Mixed 3, restrict = NoRestrict, uargs = UArgs, urules = URules, selector = Nothing}
  + Details:
      Incompatible
